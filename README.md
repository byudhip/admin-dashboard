Admin Dashboard

This page is done to fulfill the last assignment from The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML & CSS course. Unlike the example during assignment instruction, I chose to use dark mode instead because it gave me an opportunity to be creative with the color palette. I'm happy with how it looks and probably won't update it again until I learned more about  building responsive webpage.
